## 2. Architecture & Design Decisions

### 2.1 Vertical Slice with MediatR

Each feature is implemented as a self-contained slice: a command or query record, its validator, and its handler — all in one file under `Features/{Domain}/`. Controllers are thin dispatch points that extract the caller's identity from the JWT, build the appropriate command/query, and return the result.

**Rationale:** Vertical slices keep related logic co-located and eliminate the need to navigate across multiple layers (service → repository → context) to understand a single feature. When a requirement changes, exactly one file changes.

### 2.2 CQRS Separation

Read operations (`GetXxxQuery`) and write operations (`XxxCommand`) are separate MediatR messages with separate handlers. They share no base class.

**Rationale:** Commands and queries have different concerns — commands enforce business rules and produce side effects, queries optimise for projection efficiency. Keeping them separate prevents queries from accidentally picking up command-side logic and vice versa.

### 2.3 Validation Pipeline Behavior

`ValidationBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>` is an open-generic MediatR `IPipelineBehavior` registered via the standard DI container. It runs all `IValidator<TRequest>` implementations before the handler executes.

**Rationale:** Cross-cutting validation belongs in the pipeline, not in individual handlers. Handlers can assume their inputs are structurally valid and focus exclusively on business logic.

### 2.4 Global Exception Middleware

`ExceptionMiddleware` is the first middleware in the pipeline. It catches all unhandled exceptions and maps them to consistent JSON error responses.

**Rationale:** Controllers never contain try/catch blocks. Exceptions are the natural flow-control mechanism for error conditions (not found, forbidden, validation failure), and middleware ensures the response shape is uniform regardless of which feature throws.

### 2.5 Soft Deletes via Global Query Filters

`Profile`, `TodoList`, and `TodoItem` have a `DeletedAt` nullable timestamp. EF Core global query filters (`HasQueryFilter(x => x.DeletedAt == null)`) automatically exclude deleted records from all queries without any caller effort.

**Rationale:** Soft deletes preserve referential integrity (activity logs, item history) and allow potential recovery. Global filters ensure deleted records are invisible by default.

### 2.6 Role-Based List Access

Each list has a many-to-many `ListMember` join table with a `MemberRole` enum (`Owner`, `Contributor`). All access checks query `ListMembers` directly in the handler — there is no separate authorisation layer.

**Rationale:** List ownership is a domain concept, not an infrastructure one. Embedding the role check directly in each handler makes the authorisation logic explicit and co-located with the business rule that depends on it.

### 2.7 Auto-Migration on Startup

`Database.Migrate()` is called in `Program.cs` during application startup inside a scoped service scope. This applies any pending EF migrations automatically when the API starts.

**Rationale:** Eliminates the need to manually run `dotnet ef database update` when deploying or after adding new migrations. Migrations are applied exactly once per pending migration, with EF Core's `__EFMigrationsHistory` table preventing re-application.

### 2.8 Email with Dev Console Fallback

`IEmailService` / `SmtpEmailService` sends email via MailKit. When `Email:Smtp:Host` is empty or missing in configuration, the full email body is logged to the console instead of sending — this allows invite links to be tested locally without any SMTP setup.

**Rationale:** Requiring a real mail server for local development would add friction for every developer. The fallback makes the feature fully exercisable with only the console output.

## 3. Domain Model

```
Profile ──< ListMember >── TodoList ──< TodoItem >── TodoItemTag >── Tag
    │                                                                  │
    └── SentRequests / ReceivedRequests (Friend)     Profile ────────┘
    └── Tags (owned by Profile)
    └── ActivityLogs
    └── Invitations (as Inviter)
```

### Entities

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Profile` | User account. Stores credentials, display info, and soft-delete marker. |
| `TodoList` | Container for items. Has members, a title, and optional `ClosedAt` timestamp. Soft-deletable. |
| `ListMember` | Join table between Profile and TodoList carrying the member's `Role`. |
| `TodoItem` | An individual task. Has content, status, optional notes, due date, assignment, and a star flag. Soft-deletable. |
| `TaskStatus` | Lookup table (seeded): Not Started, Partial, Complete, Abandoned. |
| `Tag` | A user-owned label with a hex colour. Scoped to the owning profile. |
| `TodoItemTag` | Join table between TodoItem and Tag (many-to-many). |
| `Friend` | A directed relationship row tracking a friend request lifecycle via `Status`. |
| `Invitation` | An email invitation sent to an unregistered address by a user. Token-based, single-use. |
| `ActivityLog` | Immutable audit record for list-level actions. |

### Enums

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `MemberRole` | `Owner`, `Contributor` |
| `FriendStatus` | `Pending`, `Accepted`, `Blocked` |

---

## 4. Data Design & Reasoning

### 4.1 Composite Primary Keys

`ListMember (ListId, ProfileId)`, `TodoItemTag (ItemId, TagId)`, and `Friend (RequesterId, AddresseeId)` use composite PKs rather than surrogate integer IDs.

**Reasoning:** The combination of FKs is naturally unique and semantically meaningful. A surrogate key would add no information while masking the actual constraint.

### 4.2 Enum Stored as String

`ListMember.Role`, `Friend.Status`, and related enums are stored as `varchar` strings rather than integers.

**Reasoning:** Strings are human-readable when inspecting the database directly, survive enum reordering without a migration, and make the schema self-documenting.

### 4.3 DueDate as TEXT

`TodoItem.DueDate` is stored as a nullable `TEXT` column (max 10 chars, enforced format `YYYY-MM-DD`) rather than a `DateTime` or `DateOnly`.

**Reasoning:** Due dates are calendar dates with no time or timezone component. A plain date string sorts and compares correctly as text, maps trivially to the frontend's date input, and avoids SQLite datetime handling quirks.

### 4.4 Friend Model (Directed, Single-Row)

A friendship is represented as a single row `(RequesterId, AddresseeId, Status)`. Declining removes the row (not `Blocked`) so the requester can try again.

**Reasoning:** A symmetric two-row model introduces update anomalies. A single directed row with a status column keeps state in one place. Removing the row on decline preserves re-send capability.

### 4.5 DeleteBehavior.Restrict on Friend FKs

**Reasoning:** If a Profile is soft-deleted, the Friend row should remain for historical accuracy. `Restrict` prevents accidental hard-cascade deletion.

### 4.6 DeleteBehavior.SetNull on TodoItem.AssignedTo

**Reasoning:** Removing a list member should not destroy their in-progress work. Null assignee is a valid, meaningful state ("unassigned").

### 4.7 ClosedAt on TodoList

`TodoList.ClosedAt` is a nullable `DateTime?` column. A null value means the list is active; a non-null value means the list is closed and the timestamp records when.

**Reasoning:** Closing is a one-way state transition (currently) that should be recorded as a point-in-time event rather than a boolean flag. Storing the timestamp makes "closed on" display trivial and preserves auditability. A boolean flag would lose when the close occurred.

### 4.8 Invitation Token as URL-Safe Base64

Invitation tokens are 22-character URL-safe base64 strings derived from a `Guid.NewGuid()` (128 bits of entropy). `+` and `/` are replaced with `-` and `_`; trailing padding is stripped.

**Reasoning:** 128 bits of randomness is cryptographically unguessable. URL-safe encoding avoids percent-encoding in query strings. Guid-derived tokens are simple to generate without an external library.

### 4.9 EF Bidirectional Friend Query

Friend queries (for both the friends list and addable-friends list) use two separate EF LINQ queries — one for the "sent" direction and one for the "received" direction — concatenated in memory.

**Reasoning:** EF Core cannot translate a conditional navigation property expression (e.g. `? :` ternary selecting between `f.Addressee` and `f.Requester`) to SQL. Two simple queries are more readable, testable, and performant than a raw SQL workaround.

### 4.10 DueDate Sort: Nulls Last

When sorting items by due date ascending, the query uses `OrderBy(i => i.DueDate == null).ThenBy(i => i.DueDate)`. This ensures items with no due date always appear at the bottom regardless of sort direction.

**Reasoning:** SQLite sorts NULLs before non-null values in ascending order. Surfacing undated tasks above dated ones is counterintuitive — users want to see approaching deadlines first.

### 4.11 Three-Tier Item Sort Priority

All item queries apply a fixed three-tier sort before the user's chosen sort column:

1. **Active before resolved** — Not Started (1) and Partial (2) tasks sort before Complete (3) and Abandoned (4), regardless of the user's selected column or direction.
2. **Starred before unstarred** — Within each activity group, starred tasks (`IsStarred = true`) float to the top.
3. **User sort** — Within each star sub-group, items are ordered by the requested column (`DueDate` or `CreatedAt`) and direction.

This priority is implemented on the backend using EF Core's `OrderBy().ThenBy()` chain and is mirrored on the frontend in a `sortItems()` pure function so mutations (star toggle, status change, due date edit) instantly re-sort the list without a round-trip.

**Reasoning:** Completed and abandoned tasks are "done" work; demoting them to the bottom keeps the actionable work visible without the user having to filter. Starring is an explicit "pay attention to this" signal that should survive any sort column choice.

---

## 5. Validation Design & Reasoning

### 5.1 Validation Layer: FluentValidation via Pipeline

All input validation is declared in `AbstractValidator<TCommand>` classes co-located with their command. The `ValidationBehavior` pipeline collects all failures before the handler runs and throws a single `ValidationException` with all messages.

### 5.2 Business Rule Validation vs. Structural Validation

Structural validation (field lengths, formats, required-ness) lives in `AbstractValidator<T>`. Business rule validation (duplicate email, not-self friend request, non-member assignment) lives in the handler and throws `ValidationException` directly with a `ValidationFailure`.

**Reasoning:** FluentValidation validators are stateless and cannot query the database. Keeping structural rules in validators and business rules in handlers provides a clean separation.

### 5.3 Specific Validation Rules and Reasoning

| Field | Rule | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| `Email` | `EmailAddress()` + `MaximumLength(256)` | RFC 5321 max; 256 gives a round number with headroom. |
| `Password` (register) | `MinimumLength(8)` | NIST SP 800-63B minimum. |
| `DisplayName` | `NotEmpty()` + `MaximumLength(256)` | Arbitrary display names; 256 chars is a practical ceiling. |
| `Title` (list) | `NotEmpty()` + `MaximumLength(256)` | Prevents empty lists; 256 is a practical UI ceiling. |
| `Content` (item) | `NotEmpty()` + `MaximumLength(512)` | Task descriptions can be longer than names. |
| `Notes` (item) | `MaximumLength(256)` | Supplementary field; 256 chars for a brief annotation. |
| `DueDate` | `Matches(@"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$")` | Enforces `YYYY-MM-DD` format; rejects ambiguous formats. |
| `StatusId` | `InclusiveBetween(1, 4)` | Maps to the four seeded `TaskStatus` rows. |
| `Color` (tag) | `Matches(@"^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$")` | Strict CSS hex colour; ensures correct rendering. |
| `Page` | `GreaterThanOrEqualTo(1)` | 1-based paging; page 0 is semantically meaningless. |
| `PageSize` | `InclusiveBetween(1, 100)` | Prevents zero-size requests and caps result set size. |
| `Role` (member) | Valid enum value | Prevents invalid role strings from being persisted. |
| `Name` (tag) | `NotEmpty()` + `MaximumLength(100)` | Tags are short labels. |

### 5.4 Close List Validation

The `CloseListCommand` handler (not a FluentValidation validator) enforces:
1. Caller must be the list Owner
2. List must not already be closed
3. List must have at least one task
4. All tasks must be in status Partial (2), Complete (3), or Abandoned (4) — none may be Not Started (1)

**Reasoning:** These are business rules that require database queries (item statuses, existing `ClosedAt` value), making them unsuitable for a stateless FluentValidation validator.

### 5.5 Login Uses NotFoundException, Not ValidationException

Invalid credentials throw `NotFoundException` (→ 404) rather than a 400 validation error to prevent user enumeration.

---

## 6. API Design & Reasoning

### 6.1 Resource Hierarchy

Items and members are nested under lists (`/api/lists/{listId}/items`, `/api/lists/{listId}/members`) because they have no meaningful existence outside their parent list. Tags are a top-level resource (`/api/tags`) because they are owned by the user, not by a list.

### 6.2 PATCH for Partial Updates

`PATCH` is used for all update endpoints. Item updates support explicit `ClearDueDate` and `ClearAssignee` boolean flags to resolve the `null` = "clear" vs "leave unchanged" ambiguity.

### 6.3 Add Member by Profile ID vs. Email

Two endpoints exist for adding list members:
- `POST /api/lists/{listId}/members` — adds by email address (general purpose)
- `POST /api/lists/{listId}/members/{profileId}` — adds by profile ID (used by the "add friend" flow)

**Reasoning:** The friends picker UI already has the friend's `profileId` from the `addable-friends` endpoint. Requiring the caller to look up the email to pass back is unnecessary round-tripping. The profileId endpoint also avoids re-validating email format.

### 6.4 Addable Friends Endpoint

`GET /api/lists/{listId}/addable-friends` returns the caller's accepted friends who are not already members of the specified list, sorted by display name.

**Reasoning:** Computing the exclusion set (current members) on the client requires two separate API calls and client-side set subtraction. A dedicated server-side endpoint returns only actionable data and is more efficient.

### 6.5 Friend Request Returns Invitation Result

`POST /api/friends` returns `200 { invitationSent: bool }` rather than `204 No Content`:
- `invitationSent: false` — the email matched an existing account; a pending friend request was created
- `invitationSent: true` — no account found; an invitation email was sent to that address

**Reasoning:** The caller needs to know which path was taken to display the appropriate success message. `204` would force the UI to guess or make a follow-up request.

### 6.6 List Close Endpoint

`POST /api/lists/{listId}/close` closes a list. It returns the updated `TodoListResponse` (with `closedAt` populated) so the client can update its local state without a follow-up GET.

**Reasoning:** POST (not PATCH) is used because closing is a domain action with specific preconditions, not a generic field update. It cannot be undone via the same endpoint. Using a named action route (`.../close`) makes the intent explicit.

### 6.7 HTTP Status Codes

| Scenario | Code |
|---|---|
| Resource created | `201 Created` + `Location` header |
| Successful update / action | `200 OK` + updated resource |
| Delete / no-content action | `204 No Content` |
| Validation failure | `400 Bad Request` |
| Invalid/missing token | `401 Unauthorized` |
| Insufficient permissions | `403 Forbidden` |
| Resource not found | `404 Not Found` |
| Server fault | `500 Internal Server Error` |

---

## 7. Authentication & Security

### 7.1 JWT Bearer Tokens

JWT tokens are issued on register and login. All endpoints except `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` require a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

**Token claims:**
| Claim | Value |
|---|---|
| `NameIdentifier` | Profile GUID |
| `Email` | Profile email |
| `Name` | Profile display name |

**Configuration:**
- `Jwt:Key` — HMAC-SHA256 signing secret (minimum 32 characters)
- `Jwt:Issuer` — Validated issuer string
- `Jwt:Audience` — Validated audience string
- `Jwt:ExpiryHours` — Token lifetime (default: 24 hours)
- `ClockSkew: TimeSpan.Zero` — No leeway on token expiry; tokens expire exactly when they say

**Key setup:** `appsettings.json` deliberately ships with no `Jwt:Key` value — the app fails fast on startup if the key is missing or shorter than 32 bytes, so production deployments cannot accidentally run with a default secret.

- **Development:** `appsettings.Development.json` contains a clearly-labelled dev-only key so `dotnet run` works out of the box. This file is checked in but the key it holds is never used in production (the Development environment is never active there).
- **Production:** Supply `Jwt:Key` via an environment variable (`Jwt__Key=<secret>`) or .NET User Secrets. Never commit a real secret to source control. Minimum 32 bytes (256 bits) for HMAC-SHA256.

### 7.2 Password Hashing

BCrypt is used for password hashing. Passwords are never stored or logged in plaintext.

### 7.3 CORS

CORS is configured from `AllowedOrigins` in appsettings (comma-separated). Any header and method is allowed for those origins.

---

## 8. Error Handling

`ExceptionMiddleware` is the outermost middleware and handles all exceptions.

| Exception Type | HTTP Status | Response Title |
|---|---|---|
| `NotFoundException` | 404 | "Not Found" |
| `UnauthorizedException` | 401 | "Unauthorized" |
| `ForbiddenException` | 403 | "Forbidden" |
| `ValidationException` | 400 | "Validation Failed" |
| Any other exception | 500 | Exception type + message (Development) / "An unexpected error occurred." (Production) |

---

### Lists

| Operation | Method | Route | Auth | Request Body | Success Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Get all lists | `GET` | `/api/lists` | Bearer | — | `200` `TodoListResponse[]` |
| Get list by ID | `GET` | `/api/lists/{listId}` | Bearer | — | `200` `TodoListResponse` |
| Create list | `POST` | `/api/lists` | Bearer | `{ title }` | `201` + Location + `TodoListResponse` |
| Rename list | `PATCH` | `/api/lists/{listId}` | Bearer (Owner) | `{ title }` | `200` `TodoListResponse` |
| Close list | `POST` | `/api/lists/{listId}/close` | Bearer (Owner) | — | `200` `TodoListResponse` |
| Delete list | `DELETE` | `/api/lists/{listId}` | Bearer (Owner) | — | `204` |
| Get addable friends | `GET` | `/api/lists/{listId}/addable-friends` | Bearer (Member) | — | `200` `AddableFriendResponse[]` |
| Get list tags     | `GET`  | `/api/lists/{listId}/tags`     | Bearer (Member) | —  | `200` `TagDto[]` |
| Get activity log  | `GET`  | `/api/lists/{listId}/activity` | Bearer (Member) | —  | `200` `ActivityLogResponse[]` |

**TodoListResponse shape:**
```json
{
  "id": "guid",
  "title": "string",
  "role": "Owner|Contributor",
  "ownerName": "string",
  "contributorNames": ["string"],
  "memberCount": 0,
  "notStartedCount": 0,
  "partialCount": 0,
  "completeCount": 0,
  "abandonedCount": 0,
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime",
  "closedAt": "datetime|null",
  "tags": [{ "id": "guid", "name": "string", "color": "#RRGGBB" }]
}
```

**AddableFriendResponse shape:**
```json
{
  "profileId": "guid",
  "displayName": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "avatarUrl": "string|null"
}
```

**TagDto shape:**
```json
{ "id": "guid", "name": "string", "color": "#RRGGBB" }
```

**ActivityLogResponse shape:**
```json
{ "id": "guid", "actionType": "string", "actorName": "string", "detail": "string|null", "timestamp": "datetime" }
```

**Activity action types:**

| Action type | When logged | `detail` content |
|---|---|---|
| `ItemCreated` | Task added to list | Task content (truncated to 80 chars) |
| `StatusChanged` | Task status cycled | `"<content> → <new status>"` |
| `ItemDeleted` | Task deleted | Task content |
| `MemberAdded` | Collaborator added | New member's display name |
| `ListClosed` | List closed by owner | — |
| `TagAdded` | Tag applied to a task (only on first application) | `"\"<tag name>\" on <task content>"` |
| `TagRemoved` | Tag removed from a task | `"\"<tag name>\" from <task content>"` |
| `NotesUpdated` | Task notes changed to a different value | Task content |

> **Idempotency:** `TagAdded` is only logged when the tag is genuinely new — re-applying an already-applied tag produces no duplicate log entry. `NotesUpdated` is only logged when the submitted notes value differs from the stored value.

**List close business rules:**
- Only the Owner can close a list
- The list must have at least one task
- All tasks must be in status Partial (2), Complete (3), or Abandoned (4) — no Not Started (1) tasks allowed
- An already-closed list cannot be closed again (400)
- Closed lists are read-only in the UI (no new tasks, no edits, no status cycling)

### Items

| Operation | Method | Route | Auth | Request Body / Query | Success Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Get items (paged) | `GET` | `/api/lists/{listId}/items` | Bearer (Member) | `?page&pageSize&search&statusIds&sortBy&ascending` | `200` `PagedResult<TodoItemResponse>` |
| Get item by ID | `GET` | `/api/lists/{listId}/items/{itemId}` | Bearer (Member) | — | `200` `TodoItemResponse` |
| Create item | `POST` | `/api/lists/{listId}/items` | Bearer (Member) | `{ content, notes?, dueDate?, assignedToId? }` | `201` `TodoItemResponse` |
| Update item | `PATCH` | `/api/lists/{listId}/items/{itemId}` | Bearer (Member) | `{ content?, statusId?, notes?, dueDate?, assignedToId?, clearDueDate?, clearAssignee?, isStarred? }` | `200` `TodoItemResponse` |
| Delete item | `DELETE` | `/api/lists/{listId}/items/{itemId}` | Bearer (Member) | — | `204` |

**Query parameters for GET items:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | int | 1 | Page number (≥ 1) |
| `pageSize` | int | 20 | Items per page (1–100) |
| `search` | string | — | Substring match on Content and Notes |
| `statusIds` | int[] | — | Filter to specific status IDs (1–4) |
| `sortBy` | enum | `CreatedAt` | `CreatedAt`, `DueDate`, or `Content` |
| `ascending` | bool | `true` | Sort direction. When sorting by DueDate, items with no due date always appear last regardless of direction. |

**TodoItemResponse shape:**
```json
{
  "id": "guid",
  "listId": "guid",
  "content": "string",
  "status": { "id": 1, "name": "Not Started" },
  "notes": "string|null",
  "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD|null",
  "isStarred": false,
  "assignedTo": { "id": "guid", "displayName": "string" } | null,
  "tags": [{ "id": "guid", "name": "string", "color": "#RRGGBB" }],
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime"
}
```

**Notes field behaviour:**
- Sending `notes: "some text"` in a PATCH sets the notes
- Sending `notes: ""` (empty string) clears any existing notes
- Omitting `notes` from the PATCH body leaves notes unchanged

**Task status values:**

| ID | Name | Allows list close? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Not Started | No |
| 2 | Partial | Yes |
| 3 | Complete | Yes |
| 4 | Abandoned | Yes |

---

### Members

| Operation | Method | Route | Auth | Request Body | Success Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Get members | `GET` | `/api/lists/{listId}/members` | Bearer (Member) | — | `200` `MemberResponse[]` |
| Add member by email | `POST` | `/api/lists/{listId}/members` | Bearer (Owner) | `{ email, role }` | `200` `MemberResponse` |
| Add friend as member | `POST` | `/api/lists/{listId}/members/{profileId}` | Bearer (Owner) | — | `200` `MemberResponse` |
| Update member role | `PATCH` | `/api/lists/{listId}/members/{profileId}` | Bearer (Owner) | `{ role }` | `200` `MemberResponse` |
| Remove member | `DELETE` | `/api/lists/{listId}/members/{profileId}` | Bearer (Owner) | — | `204` |

**MemberResponse shape:**
```json
{
  "profileId": "guid",
  "displayName": "string",
  "avatarUrl": "string|null",
  "role": "Owner|Contributor",
  "joinedAt": "datetime"
}
```

**Member business rules:**
- Only the Owner can add, remove, or change roles of members
- The Owner's own role cannot be changed or removed
- Adding a profile already on the list returns 400
- `POST /members/{profileId}` always adds the friend as `Contributor`
- `POST /members/{profileId}` requires the target to be an accepted friend of the caller (enforced at the UI layer via `addable-friends`; the endpoint itself only validates membership)

### Tags

| Operation | Method | Route | Auth | Request Body | Success Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Get tags | `GET` | `/api/tags` | Bearer | — | `200` `TagDto[]` |
| Create tag | `POST` | `/api/tags` | Bearer | `{ name, color }` | `200` `TagDto` |
| Delete tag | `DELETE` | `/api/tags/{tagId}` | Bearer (Owner) | — | `204` |

```json
{
  "friends": [{ "profileId": "guid", "displayName": "string", "email": "string", "avatarUrl": "string|null" }],
  "pendingReceived": [{ "requesterId": "guid", "displayName": "string", "email": "string", "avatarUrl": "string|null", "createdAt": "datetime" }],
  "pendingSent": [{ "addresseeId": "guid", "displayName": "string", "email": "string", "avatarUrl": "string|null", "createdAt": "datetime" }]
}
```

**Friend business rules:**
- Cannot send a request to yourself (400)
- If the email matches an existing account, a pending friend request is created and `invitationSent: false` is returned
- If the email does not match any account, an invitation email is sent and `invitationSent: true` is returned; a pending `Invitation` row is created
- Duplicate invitations to the same unregistered email are silently ignored (idempotent)
- Declining a request removes the row — the requester can send again
- `DELETE /api/friends/{friendId}` works whether the relationship is accepted (remove friend) or pending-sent (cancel request)

### Invitations

| Operation | Method | Route | Auth | Request Body | Success Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accept invitation | `POST` | `/api/invitations/accept` | Bearer | `{ token }` | `204` |

**Invitation flow:**
1. User A sends a friend request to an email address that has no account
2. API creates an `Invitation` row and sends an email with a link: `{AppUrl}/register?invite={token}&email={email}`
3. Recipient clicks the link, arrives at the register page with email pre-filled and an invite banner
4. After registering, the client calls `POST /api/invitations/accept` with the token
5. API creates a pending `Friend` row from User A to the new user and marks the invitation as accepted
6. New user is redirected to the Friends page where they can see and accept the request

**Invitation business rules:**
- Tokens are 22-character URL-safe base64 strings (128-bit GUID entropy)
- Tokens are single-use; replaying an accepted token returns 404
- Inviting yourself is rejected (400)
- If a friendship already exists between the inviter and acceptor, the accept is silently successful

## 10. Configuration Reference

### appsettings.json

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=honeydo.db"
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Issuer": "HoneyDo",
    "Audience": "HoneyDo",
    "ExpiryHours": "24"
  },
  // Jwt:Key must come from appsettings.Development.json (dev) or
  // environment variable / user-secrets (prod). Never committed here.
  "AppUrl": "http://localhost:5173",
  "AllowedOrigins": "http://localhost:5173",
  "Email": {
    "FromName": "HoneyDo",
    "FromAddress": "noreply@honeydo.app",
    "Smtp": {
      "Host": "",
      "Port": "587",
      "Username": "",
      "Password": ""
    }
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

**Email configuration notes:**
- Leave `Email:Smtp:Host` empty for development — the full email body (including invite links) will be logged to the API console instead of sent
- Set `AppUrl` to the frontend's base URL so that invite links in emails point to the correct host

### First-Time Clone Setup

After cloning the repository, run this once to enable the pre-commit hook that runs the test suite before every commit:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This wires up `.githooks/pre-commit`, which runs `dotnet test` automatically before git records each commit. If any test fails the commit is aborted and the failure is shown — fix it, then commit again. Skipping this step means the hook will not run and broken code can reach the repo.

### Running Locally

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API (auto-applies pending migrations on startup)
cd HoneyDo
dotnet run

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd honeydo-client
npm run dev
```

- API: `http://localhost:5277`
- Frontend / Vite dev proxy: `http://localhost:5173`

The Vite dev server proxies all `/api/*` requests to `http://localhost:5277`, so the frontend always uses relative `/api/...` paths.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend unit + integration tests
dotnet test HoneyDo.Tests/HoneyDo.Tests.csproj

# Frontend unit + integration tests (Vitest)
cd honeydo-client && npm test

# Frontend E2E tests (Playwright — requires the Vite dev server to be running,
# or Playwright will start it automatically)
cd honeydo-client && npm run test:e2e
```

### Regenerating TypeScript API Types

The frontend types in `src/api/generated.ts` are auto-generated from the OpenAPI spec (`honeydo-client/HoneyDo.json`). Regenerate whenever backend DTOs or endpoints change:

```bash
# Step 1: Regenerate the OpenAPI spec from the running backend
#   Requires the Jwt:Key to be set (it starts the app to introspect it).
$env:Jwt__Key="your-dev-key-here"
dotnet build HoneyDo/HoneyDo.csproj /p:GenerateApiSpec=true
#   This writes honeydo-client/HoneyDo.json

# Step 2: Regenerate the TypeScript types from the spec
cd honeydo-client && npm run generate
#   This writes src/api/generated.ts
```

`src/api/types.ts` re-exports from `generated.ts` under stable names (and overrides a few fields where the .NET 10 OpenAPI emitter uses a `number | string` union for integer fields). All page imports use `types.ts` — only `types.ts` needs adjusting if the generated shape changes.

### Migrations

Migrations are applied automatically via `Database.Migrate()` in `Program.cs` on every API startup. No manual `dotnet ef database update` step is needed during normal development.

To generate a new migration after changing the domain model:

```bash
# Stop the running API first (it locks HoneyDo.exe), then:
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> --project HoneyDo/HoneyDo.csproj

# Restart the API — it will apply the migration automatically
dotnet run --project HoneyDo/HoneyDo.csproj
```

## 11. Frontend Reference

### Pages

| Page | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ListsPage` | `/` | Shows active lists and closed lists in separate sections. Create new lists. |
| `ListDetailPage` | `/lists/:listId` | Task list with sorting, notes, and member management. Close list button for owners. |
| `FriendsPage` | `/friends` | Send/accept/decline friend requests. View current friends. |
| `ProfilePage` | `/profile` | View and update display name, phone number, avatar URL, and password. Manage personal tags. Choose color scheme (System / Light / Dark). |
| `LoginPage` | `/login` | Email/password authentication. |
| `RegisterPage` | `/register` | Account creation. Handles invite links (`?invite=token&email=...`). |
| `ActivityPage` | `/lists/:listId/activity` | Chronological activity log for a list (newest first). Shows actor, action, and detail. |

### List Detail Page Features

- **Sort toolbar**: Switch between Due Date and Created Date sorting; toggle ascending/descending with the sort-direction icon button. Default is Due Date ascending (earliest first, undated tasks at bottom).
- **Sort priority**: Regardless of the chosen sort column, the list always applies a three-tier priority: active tasks (Not Started / Partial) before resolved (Complete / Abandoned) → starred tasks before unstarred → user's chosen sort column. See §4.11 for details.
- **Column headers**: Status · Task · Created · Due Date · (actions)
- **Star**: Each task row has a star icon (☆/★). Clicking it toggles the `isStarred` flag, which immediately re-sorts the list so starred tasks float to the top of the active group. Stars persist across sessions.
- **Notes**: Displayed as italic gray text below task content. Click "+ Add note" or the pencil icon to open the edit form which includes a notes textarea with a 256-character counter.
- **Edit form fields**: Content (text), Due Date (native date picker with a "Clear" link), Notes (textarea), Tags. Saving re-sorts the list instantly if the due date changed position.
- **Members panel**: Toggle with the Members button in the header. Shows all members with role badges. Owners can remove contributors and add accepted friends as collaborators directly.
- **Close List button**: Enabled when all tasks are resolved (Partial/Complete/Abandoned); disabled with a tooltip when not eligible. Confirm dialog before closing.
- **Read-only mode**: When a list is closed, the new-task form is hidden, status buttons become plain labels, and edit/delete/add-note actions are hidden. Stars remain interactive.
- **Tags**: A tag popover button in the new-task creation bar lets you pre-select tags before adding a task. During editing, a tag picker shows all tags available on the list (including co-members' tags). Applied tags appear as colored badges below the task content in view mode.
- **Activity log**: Each list has a chronological activity feed accessible via the Activity button in the list header. Entries record who performed an action, what it was, and a brief detail. Tracked actions include task creation/deletion/status changes, member additions, list close, and tag apply/remove/notes changes.

### Lists Page Sections

- **Active**: All lists without a `closedAt` value. Displays per-status task counts (not started / partial / complete / abandoned — only non-zero statuses shown, each color-coded). Shows Owner and Collaborators explicitly. Supports:
  - **Text search**: Filters active lists by title substring.
  - **Tag filter**: A "Tags" button opens a popover listing all tags used across any active list the user is a member of. Selected tags filter the list to only entries that have at least one matching tagged item; matched tags are shown as small indicators on each list row.
- **Closed**: All lists with a `closedAt` value, sorted most-recently-closed first. Dimmed styling. Only shown when at least one closed list exists.

### Color Scheme

The app detects and respects the browser/OS dark mode preference on first load. Users can override the default via:
- The sun/moon toggle icon in the persistent header (quick switch between light and dark)
- The **Appearance** card on the Profile page, which offers three options:
  - **System** — follows the OS preference automatically (`prefers-color-scheme` media query)
  - **Light** — always light
  - **Dark** — always dark

The preference is persisted in `localStorage` under the key `honeydo-color-scheme` via Mantine's `localStorageColorSchemeManager`.

### TypeScript API Types (`src/api/types.ts`)

Types are auto-generated from the backend's OpenAPI 3.1 spec via `openapi-typescript`. `src/api/generated.ts` contains the raw generated output; `src/api/types.ts` re-exports everything under stable names used throughout the app. See "Regenerating TypeScript API Types" above.

```typescript
TodoList         // id, title, role, ownerName, contributorNames, memberCount,
                 // notStartedCount, partialCount, completeCount, abandonedCount,
                 // createdAt, updatedAt, closedAt, tags
TodoItem         // id, listId, content, status, notes, dueDate, isStarred, assignedTo, tags, createdAt, updatedAt
Tag              // id, name, color
Member           // profileId, displayName, avatarUrl, role, joinedAt
AddableFriend    // profileId, displayName, email, avatarUrl
FriendInfo       // profileId, displayName, email, avatarUrl
ReceivedRequestInfo  // requesterId, displayName, email, avatarUrl, createdAt
SentRequestInfo      // addresseeId, displayName, email, avatarUrl, createdAt
FriendsResult    // friends, pendingReceived, pendingSent
SendRequestResult    // invitationSent: boolean
ActivityLogEntry // id, actionType, actorName, detail, timestamp
```

## 12. Testing Strategy

The frontend uses a three-layer test pyramid:

### Layer 1 — Unit tests (Vitest + Testing Library)

Files: `src/api/*.test.ts`, `src/context/*.test.tsx`

Low-level unit tests for the API client (request formatting, error handling, 401 auto-logout) and the auth context (token persistence, login/logout state transitions). No HTTP or DOM rendering involved.

### Layer 2 — Page integration tests (Vitest + Testing Library + MSW + jest-axe)

Files: `src/pages/*.test.tsx`

Each page test file renders the real page component inside `renderWithProviders` (wraps with `MantineProvider`, `MemoryRouter`, and `AuthProvider`) and intercepts HTTP calls with MSW. Tests exercise complete user flows — typing into form fields, clicking buttons, verifying the DOM updates — without a real browser or backend.

**Test infrastructure (`src/test/`):**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fixtures.ts` | Typed factory functions: `makeList()`, `makeItem()`, `makeMember()`, `makeProfile()`, `makePagedResult()`. All return sensible defaults; accept partial overrides. |
| `handlers.ts` | Default MSW request handlers for all API endpoints (happy-path responses). Tests override specific handlers with `server.use(...)`. |
| `server.ts` | `setupServer(...handlers)` — the MSW Node server instance. |
| `setup.ts` | Global test setup: `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers, `jest-axe` `toHaveNoViolations` matcher, `window.matchMedia` stub (jsdom doesn't implement it; Mantine requires it), MSW lifecycle hooks. |
| `renderWithProviders.tsx` | Render helper. Seeds `localStorage` with a test token for authenticated tests; clears it for auth-flow tests. Accepts `{ authenticated, initialRoute }` options. |

**MSW handler override pattern:** `server.resetHandlers()` runs in `afterEach` (wired in `setup.ts`), so per-test overrides are automatically torn down. Register overrides with `server.use(...)` inside `it()` blocks, before any user interactions.

**Accessibility:** Every page test file includes an axe test that waits for the page to finish loading, then asserts `expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations()`. Axe caught and surfaced two unlabeled `<input type="date">` elements in `ListDetailPage` that were fixed before merge.

**Mantine selector notes:**
- `getByRole('textbox', { name: /email/i })` — email inputs (Mantine's required-star span is `aria-hidden`, so `name` matches cleanly without it)
- `getByPlaceholderText('Your password')` — password inputs (type="password" has no implicit ARIA role; placeholder is the reliable selector)
- `getByRole('button', { name: /sign in/i })` — submit buttons

### Layer 3 — E2E tests (Playwright)

Files: `e2e/*.spec.ts`

Critical-path flows run against the real Vite app in a Chromium browser. All API calls are intercepted with `page.route()` — no backend required.

**E2E infrastructure (`e2e/helpers.ts`):**

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `seedAuth(page)` | Calls `page.addInitScript()` to seed localStorage with a test token before the page loads. |
| `setupDefaultRoutes(page)` | Registers `page.route()` handlers for all API endpoints (happy-path responses). Uses regex patterns to correctly match paths with query strings and sub-resources. |
| `makeList / makeItem / makeProfile / makePagedResult` | Same factory functions as the Vitest layer, used to build route response bodies. |
| `json(route, body)` / `noContent(route)` | Convenience wrappers around `route.fulfill()`. |

**Route registration order:** Playwright uses the most-recently-registered handler for a matching route. Register test-specific overrides with `page.route(...)` *after* calling `setupDefaultRoutes(page)` and *before* `page.goto(...)`.

**URL pattern note:** `page.route('/api/lists/*')` does not match `/api/lists/list-1/items` — `*` in Playwright route strings does not cross path separators. All multi-segment patterns in `helpers.ts` use regex (e.g. `/\/api\/lists\/[^/]+\/items(\?.*)?$/`) to correctly match paths with sub-resources and query strings.

**Coverage (14 tests across 3 files):**

| File | Tests |
|---|---|
| `auth.spec.ts` | Login (valid credentials → home), login (wrong credentials → error), unauthenticated redirect → /login, register → home |
| `lists.spec.ts` | View list titles, empty state, create list, delete list (with confirm dialog), search filter |
| `tasks.spec.ts` | View list detail, empty state, add task, cycle status, delete task |

## 13. CI Pipeline

CI runs on every push and pull request to `main` via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Three parallel jobs:

### `backend` job

1. Restore NuGet packages
2. Build in Release mode
3. Run 159 xUnit tests (WebApplicationFactory, EF InMemory)
4. Vulnerability scan: `dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive` — fails if any known CVE affects a direct or transitive package

### `frontend` job

1. Install npm dependencies (`--legacy-peer-deps` for openapi-typescript TS6 peer dep)
2. Vulnerability scan: `npm audit --audit-level=high` — fails on high/critical severity
3. Run Vitest unit + integration tests (49 tests)
4. TypeScript + Vite production build

### `e2e` job

1. Install npm dependencies
2. Install Playwright Chromium browser + system dependencies
3. Run Playwright E2E tests (14 tests, Chromium only)
4. On failure: upload `playwright-report/` as a GitHub Actions artifact (7-day retention) for trace and screenshot inspection

### Pre-commit hook

`.githooks/pre-commit` runs the full backend test suite (`dotnet test`) before every local commit. Wire it up once after cloning:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Dependabot

`.github/dependabot.yml` sends weekly automated PRs for:
- GitHub Actions (pinned action versions)
- NuGet packages
- npm packages (scoped to `honeydo-client/`)

## 14. Known Tradeoffs

These are deliberate decisions made during development where a simpler or faster path was chosen over the production-optimal one. They are documented here so the reasoning is explicit rather than implicit.

### SQLite over PostgreSQL

SQLite makes the getting-started experience frictionless — one file, zero infrastructure, migrations apply automatically on startup. The tradeoff is that SQLite uses file-level write locks, so concurrent writes serialise and throughput collapses under meaningful load. Switching to PostgreSQL is a configuration-level change (the EF Core provider and connection string); the migration history and application code are unaffected. This is the first change to make before any serious production deployment.

### Due Dates Stored as TEXT

`TodoItem.DueDate` is a nullable `TEXT` column storing dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format rather than a `DateTime` or `DateOnly`. This was chosen because due dates are calendar dates with no time or timezone component, `YYYY-MM-DD` strings sort and compare correctly as text, and the value maps directly to and from the HTML `<input type="date">` without any conversion. The tradeoff is that SQL-level date arithmetic is limited — a query like "items due in the next 7 days" requires application-side filtering rather than a simple `WHERE` clause.

### No Optimistic Concurrency

Update handlers do not use EF Core's concurrency token mechanism (`[ConcurrencyToken]` / `rowversion`). A lost-update is possible if two members simultaneously fetch and patch the same task. In practice the collision surface is narrow — concurrent inserts don't conflict, and two members editing the same task at the same instant is an edge case for a household todo list. The right production fix is a `rowversion` column, a `HasRowVersion()` call in the DbContext, and a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` catch in update handlers that returns a 409. Deferred in exchange for simpler handler code.

### Stateless JWTs with No Revocation

Tokens issued on login remain valid until their expiry window closes regardless of logout. A user who logs out still holds a token that the API will accept for up to 24 hours. The production answer is short-lived access tokens paired with refresh tokens and a server-side revocation table (backed by Redis). Not implemented here for scope reasons; the 24-hour expiry window is an acceptable risk at this stage.

### Monorepo with a Single CI Pipeline

The frontend and backend share one repository and one CI pipeline. This simplifies the getting-started experience and ensures integration issues surface immediately. The tradeoff is deployment independence — a frontend copy fix triggers a full backend build and test run, and independent teams cannot deploy on separate cadences. At production scale these would be separate pipelines with independently versioned artifacts.

### TimeProvider Not Injected

Handlers call `DateTime.UtcNow` directly rather than using .NET 8's `System.TimeProvider`. This means time-dependent logic (token expiry, `ClosedAt` timestamps, activity log ordering) cannot be controlled in tests. No current test requires time-sensitive assertions, so there is no immediate pain. It is latent testability debt — the fix is registering `TimeProvider.System` in DI, injecting it into handlers, and using `FakeTimeProvider` in the test factory. Worth implementing when the first time-sensitive test assertion is needed.

### No Real-Time Push

The application uses a request/response model throughout. Members editing the same list do not see each other's changes until they refresh the page. For a household todo list this is an acceptable UX gap. For a true collaborative tool it would be a significant limitation — the fix is WebSockets or SignalR broadcasting mutations to subscribed clients. Deferred as out of scope for the current feature set.

### TanStack Query Not Used

Data fetching is implemented with hand-rolled `useEffect` + `useState` + loading/error state. There is no client-side cache: navigating away from a page and back always triggers a fresh network fetch. Optimistic updates are implemented correctly but are not rolled back on failure. TanStack Query would eliminate all of this boilerplate and add caching, background refetch, and proper rollback. It was deferred because migrating the existing pages — particularly `ListDetailPage` with its many interdependent mutations — is a full sprint of work with meaningful regression risk. The current implementation is correct; the missing piece is efficiency and resilience.
